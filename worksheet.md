# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/farleyknight/ruby-git
  * (B) https://bitbucket.org/kennethendfinger/git-repo

And answer the following questions about them:

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment?  ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

Setup a new IntelliJ project with a main method that will print the following message to the console when run:

~~~~~
Sheep and Wolves
~~~~~

ðŸ¤” Now setup a new bitbucket repository and have this project pushed to that repository.
You will first need to `commit`, then `push`.  Ensure you have setup an appropriate `.gitignore`
file.  The one we have in this repository is a very good start.

# Task 3

Draw a 20 by 20 grid on a 1280x720 window. Have the grid take up the 720x720 square on the left of the window.  Each cell in the grid should be 35 pixels high and wide and the grid should be drawn 10 pixels off the top and left borders of the screen.  To do this, you should use the `Graphics` class from the Java libraries.  Be sure to consult the tips page for this task (it is a link in iLearn).  Without it, you will be very confused.
